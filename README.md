Hello, I'm [@thewemonster](https://twitter.com/thewemonster) a computer nerd doing things I like and sharing them on various places. 
 
I post occasionally on [twitter](https://twitter.com/thewemonster), [my website](https://thewemonster.com), or here on [github](https://github.com/thewemonster).

I'm currently working on my cybersecurity skills in the way of my home lab and some other online resources.

I look forward to collaborating on open source projects that make an impact to improve the individual's privacy.
